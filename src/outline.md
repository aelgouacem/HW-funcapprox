1. ***question 1*** Create a function to generate the chebyshev basis polynomials, create the nodes, rescales them. Evaluate the function at the nodes, multiply the basis matrix (generated by the function) and the function evaluated at the nodes to get the chebyshev coefficients. Once the coefficients are obtained, regenerate a basis matrix with points outside the grid, use the already obtained coefficients multiplied by the new basis matrix to approximate the function. Compared the approximate function with the true solution

2. ***question 2*** used the ApproxFun package to do the same task as before

3. ***question 3*** created 9 subplots for each basis function

4. ***question 4*** 
	
	a. approximated a function using equally spaced nodes and chebyshev interpolation points
 	
	b. to be done

5. to be done
